Title: Statistical Inference of Modified Poisson-Type Graphical Models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Rong Zhang, Zhao Ren, Juan C. Celedon and Wei Chen
Maintainer: Rong Zhang <roz16@pitt.edu>
Description: Provides a novel method for both edge-wise and global statistical inference 
    with FDR control based on three modified Poisson-type graphical models: the truncated
    Poisson graphical model (TPGM), the sub-linear Poisson graphical model (SPGM) and the
    square-root Poisson graphical model (SqrtPGM). We focus on the high-dimensional settings 
    where dimension p is allowed to be far larger than sample size n and implement the method
    using efficient proximal gradient descent. The method will be potentially useful in analysis
    of large count-valued or discrete omics data (e.g. RNA-seq). Other functions in the package 
    including sample generation and data preprocessing for count-valued data. Windows users 
    should install 'Rtools' before the installation of this package.
